This project uses Python to predict life expectancy based on health and socioeconomic factors. It employs libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ².
